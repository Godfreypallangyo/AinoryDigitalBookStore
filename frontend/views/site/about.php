                                <p><strong>Ainory Peter Gesase</strong> is the author of four books focusing on spiritual issues essential for salvation. Despite facing challenges in getting the books published, he opened this website to make the books accessible to those in need of salvation.</p>
                                <p>These books provide insights into hidden truths of the Bible and offer a chance for truth-loving individuals to expand their understanding. Leaders of churches and ministries are encouraged to read the books, as even those with extensive biblical knowledge can benefit.</p>
                                <p>It's crucial to seek the truth and not cling blindly to beliefs. Many have followed false teachings unknowingly. The books challenge common beliefs and offer a fresh perspective grounded in biblical truths.</p>

(Colossians 2: 20). This verse reminds us not to keep decrees including the ten commandments and laws of the Torah and laws made by the churches of the world. If you submit yourself into such things you will not be able to do the will of God. You will not give love to people and to God.

The four books that I wrote provide some explanation about “Dying with Jesus” and I urge those who want salvation to read it and shall see Jesus’s light for salvation.</ins>

                                                    Theologians, pastors and self-proclaimed prophets and apostles have produced a misleading interpretation of Bible prophecies putting Christians into a state of confusion. A good understanding about these prophecies enhances our faith in Jesus and in God’s word and as a result the pathway to salvation becomes more clearer. Among such prophecies include the 70 weeks’ prophecy; 2300 days’ prophecy; Revelation chapter 13 prophecy; 1335 days’ prophecy; 1290 days’ prophecy and a time, times and half a time prophecy. Also, people have given misleading views about Ezekiel’s temple, the abomination of desolation and the two Bible witnesses. Kindly read the four books and see how the Spirit interpret the issues above.
