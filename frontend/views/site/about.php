                                                <strong>Ainory Peter Gesase</strong>
                                                is the author of the four books that focuses on spiritual issues key to people salvation. He failed to raise funds to get the books published and and to access self-publishing printing companies. After two years of consultation on publishing the first book titled “What I saw in the Bible” there was no promising results to get the book published. In view of that I decided to open the Website where the four books can be accessed by people who are in need of salvation. I believe that the world does not get access to blessing that God put in many people because of lack of funds and the opportunity to publish their work.
                                                God uses people at a given time to know about His secrets that are embedded in Bible verses but are prevented by Satan from being known to the world.

                                            <p>
                                                I urge truth-loving people to take time to read the books and you shall
                                                be blessed to know about the lost gospel that is key for our salvation.
                                                My special plea is for the leaders of churches and ministries who may be
                                                contented with what they teach to read the four books. God’s word is a
                                                perpetual blessing till the end of the world, no one can claim to have sufficient
                                                knowledge until when Jesus comes for the second time to take the saved ones.
                                                We learn this from Mathew 23: 34 where Jesus said that “I send unto you prophets,
                                                and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city” (Mathew 23: 34). Jesus saw the need to bring people who shall speak about the truth of God’s word because He knew that Satan shall influence people to antagonize God’s word and bring the false gospel. Even if you consider yourself to have a wider knowledge in Bible take time to read the four books and you shall be blessed. Keep reading even if you find statements that contradict your church or ministry belief because it is you may have for years or centuries travelling on a wrong belief.
                                                It is a blessing to receive the truth than to stay in belief that are man-made and not Biblical.

                                                Israelites walked with the sabbath of the fourth commandment for more that
                                                two thousand years but did not know that they were breaking the sabbath until
                                                when Jesus came to the world to die for our sins (John 7: 22-24).
                                                It is true that many if not all of us are following the false gospel
                                                without knowing and that is why it is important not to
                                                stick to our beliefs but to look for truth of God’s word.

                                                        The world has for many years travelled in spiritual uncertainty till when
                                                        Jesus came to die for our sins. But God has always been there using selected people to write about His word and the coming of His Messiah. Through His word, people knew about sin, punishment for disobeying His word, and the coming of His Son Jesus Christ, and we knew that our current world shall come to an end and the saved shall live in the new world to be created by God. However,
                                                        before the coming of Jesus people did not know exactly how to be saved and enter the new world.

                                                        The Bible teaches us that Jesus brought light to the world.
                                                        In John 8: 12 He said, “I am the light of the world”.
                                                        This is a very important statement that introduced who is Jesus to the world,
                                                        through this statement we also see that despite all the prophets and
                                                        important writings in the old testament the world was in spiritual darkness.
                                                        So, the light that was brought by Jesus was for making us see the path to the promised kingdom of God in the new world. Jesus as the light of the world was meant to tell us that those who want to enter into the new world must follow the light and keep following it until the end of the world.
                                                        In that way, the light shall lead us to the door of the new world and we shall enter.

                                                        The light of Jesus is seen and followed by
                                                        those who read, believe and live according to His word.
                                                        God gave Jesus the word to bring to the world as we read in John 12: 49;
                                                        but from John 1: 1-4, 14 we see that Jesus was in God as the word that became flesh.
                                                        So, even before he came to the world in the flesh that word was given to prophets
                                                        who wrote it for us, and when he came to the world in flesh He brought light into that word.
                                                        Here it means that by himself speaking to people and by performing miracles
                                                        He clarified things that were spoken of by the prophets and made it clear for
                                                        people to understand, in that way Jesus brought light to the world.
                                                        So, Jesus expects us to believe and follow the word that He said to the world as
                                                        we prepare to enter into the heavenly kingdom as we read from John 12: 44-50.

                                                        Jesus revealed to us the danger that shall come to the world that shall derail
                                                        people from His word and that people shall replace the truth of God with human-made
                                                        words and consequently remove them from the light of Jesus. After seeing the danger in the future Jesus gave the following statements:
                                                        <ol type="i">

                                                                <section>
                                                                    I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming, and he has no claim on me” (John 14: 30); in this verse, Jesus tells us that Satan shall come to the world.

                                                                    “For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect” (Mathew 24: 24).
                                                                    Here we see that churches of the world shall be the source of false Christians and false prophets. Through these warnings we can see the love of Jesus and that he wants all of us to be saved.

                                                                Because of false teaching and false prophecy Jesus saw that time shall come when the truth of God’s word shall be removed from the world. He also saw that people of God shall be engulfed by a false gospel and shall not have time to hear the word of God. Given that Jesus made a promise to the world which says “Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city” (Mathew 23: 34). God has led me to write His word and bring forward His word that has been lost that shall lead people to see the original light of Jesus. I urge people to reads these books and remind themselves about the truth of God’s word, in that way they shall be freed from the bondage of Satan that is contained in the churches of the world. Preachers are busy defending their churches, and others are pointing out the mistakes of certain churches and ministries but they shy away from saying that the truth of God’s word has been lost. And because of that many are led to worship Satan in churches and ministries.

                                                        The books that I have written reveal the lost God’s word and bring to you the pathway that shall make you access Jesus’s light. The main emphasis is that people should make an individual daily assessment of how they relate with their fellow human beings and if they follow what the Bible teaches. People should involve Jesus if they want change their minds, thinking and heart to be positive about other people and the word of God. Don’t spend your time on world churches and ministries instead use it to change your heart positively and start giving others love and good works. God wants us to die with Jesus and get raised in new bodies that shall live with the Holy Spirit and live by doing the works of the Spirit. In that way we shall be saved and enter into God’s kingdom. The verses below tell us about dying with Jesus:

(Colossians 2: 20). This verse reminds us not to keep decrees including the ten commandments and laws of the Torah and laws made by the churches of the world. If you submit yourself into such things you will not be able to do the will of God. You will not give love to people and to God.

                                                        <ins>Among the lost word is that of “Dying with Jesus” many practising Christians do not have a clear understanding of this phenomenon in spiritual life. The four books that I wrote provide some explanation about “Dying with Jesus” and I urge those who want salvation to read it and shall see Jesus’s light for salvation.</ins>

                                                    Theologians, pastors and self-proclaimed prophets and apostles have produced a misleading interpretation of Bible prophecies putting Christians into a state of confusion. A good understanding about these prophecies enhances our faith in Jesus and in God’s word and as a result the pathway to salvation becomes more clearer. Among such prophecies include the 70 weeks’ prophecy; 2300 days’ prophecy; Revelation chapter 13 prophecy; 1335 days’ prophecy; 1290 days’ prophecy and a time, times and half a time prophecy. Also, people have given misleading views about Ezekiel’s temple, the abomination of desolation and the two Bible witnesses. Kindly read the four books and see how the Spirit interpret the issues above.
